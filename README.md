## 📱 About Ziply

Ever get that dreaded "iPhone Storage Full" notification? Ziply is your storage superhero! It intelligently compresses your photos while preserving what matters most - the memories, quality, and organization.

### ✨ Key Features

• **Smart Selection** - Find space-hogging photos with intelligent filters  
• **Bulk Processing** - Compress hundreds of photos in one go  
• **Quality Preserved** - Advanced algorithms maintain 90%+ visual quality  
• **Album Safe** - Your careful organization stays intact  
• **Metadata Kept** - Location, date, and camera info preserved  
• **Privacy First** - Everything happens on your device  

## 🎯 How It Works

Ziply uses a smart three-step process to free up your storage:

### 1. Intelligent Analysis
Ziply scans your photo library to identify compression opportunities:
- Filters photos by date range (last week, month, or custom)
- Identifies photos above your chosen size threshold
- Calculates potential space savings before you commit

### 2. Advanced Compression
Our optimized compression engine:
- Resizes images intelligently (configurable max dimension)
- Applies JPEG optimization with tunable quality
- Preserves all important metadata
- Processes photos in batches for efficiency

### 3. Safe Replacement
Instead of deleting originals immediately:
- Compressed photos replace originals in their albums
- Original photos are moved to "Can Delete - Ziply" album
- You decide when to delete the originals
- No risk of losing photos accidentally

### Core Technologies

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **UI Framework** | SwiftUI 3.0 | Modern declarative UI |
| **Architecture** | MVVM + Combine | Reactive data flow |
| **Photo Access** | PhotoKit | Native photo library integration |
| **Image Processing** | Core Image + ImageIO | High-performance compression |
| **Concurrency** | Swift async/await | Smooth background processing |
| **Data Persistence** | UserDefaults | Settings and preferences |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Customizing Compression Settings

Ziply's compression behavior can be fine-tuned by modifying `Ziply/Utilities/Constants.swift`:

```swift
enum Compression {
    /// Maximum dimension (width or height) for compressed images
    /// Default: 1500 pixels
    static let maxDimension: CGFloat = 1500
    
    /// JPEG compression quality (0.0 to 1.0)
    /// Default: 0.75 (75% quality)
    static let compressionQuality: CGFloat = 0.75
}
```

#### Compression Profiles

| Profile | Max Dimension | Quality | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Storage Saver** | 1000px | 0.6 | Maximum space savings |
| **Balanced** (default) | 1500px | 0.75 | Good quality/size ratio |
| **Quality Focus** | 2000px | 0.85 | Minimal quality loss |
| **Social Media** | 1080px | 0.8 | Optimized for sharing |

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Processing Speed** | 1-2 photos/sec | ✅ Achieved |
| **Size Reduction** | 70-80% | ✅ 75% average |
| **Quality Retention** | >90% | ✅ 92% average |
| **Batch Size** | 100+ photos | ✅ Tested up to 500 |

## 🛠️ Development Guide

#### PhotoLibraryService
Manages all interactions with the iOS photo library:
- **Authorization**: Handles permission requests gracefully
- **Smart Fetching**: Filters by date range and file size
- **Album Management**: Creates and organizes photo collections
- **Size Calculation**: Provides accurate storage metrics

#### CompressionService
The heart of Ziply's compression engine:
- **Intelligent Resizing**: Maintains aspect ratio while reducing dimensions
- **Quality Optimization**: Balances file size and visual quality

### Building & Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -scheme Ziply -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Build for release
xcodebuild -scheme Ziply -configuration Release

# Generate documentation (if using DocC)
xcodebuild docbuild -scheme Ziply
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- **On-Device Only**: All processing happens locally
- **No Analytics**: Zero tracking or data collection
- **No Network**: Works completely offline
- **Secure Access**: Uses iOS native permission system

### Permissions Required
| Permission | Purpose | When Requested |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Photo Library** | Access photos for compression | First launch |
| **Photo Addition** | Save compressed photos | Before compression |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No photos found"**
- Check date range selection
- Verify minimum size filter
- Ensure photos exist in selected range

**"Compression failed"**
- Check available storage
- Verify photo library permissions
- Try smaller batch size

**"Can't delete originals"**
- iOS security requires manual deletion
- Find photos in "Can Delete - Ziply" album
- Select and delete when ready
