This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
    Analysis:
    Looking through the conversation chronologically:

    1. Initial setup phase: User asked me to analyze a codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file. I examined the iOS image compression project structure, found planning
    documents (description.md, brainstorm.md), and created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with project guidance.

    2. Project creation phase: User created a new Xcode project named "Ziply" (instead of ImageCompressor). I updated CLAUDE.md to reflect this name change and
    analyzed the vanilla Xcode template structure.

    3. Implementation phase: User asked me to build the app. I:
       - Cleaned up Core Data template code
       - Created folder structure for MVVM architecture
       - Implemented all 5 screens based on mockups
       - Created core services (PhotoLibraryService, AppState)
       - Fixed iOS 15 compatibility issues (NavigationStack → NavigationView)

    4. Build error fixing phase: User reported build errors. I fixed:
       - Binding issue with slider ($viewModel → custom binding)
       - MainActor issue with AppState initialization
       - Successfully built the project

    5. State management issue: User reported UI not updating and photos not being found. I:
       - Changed from @StateObject to @EnvironmentObject pattern
       - Added proper environment object injection
       - Added debug logging to photo service
       - Fixed PhotoLibraryService to properly handle authorization

    6. Current UI customization request: User showed a screenshot and requested custom date range selection with date pickers, noting the current UI only has 3 preset
     options.

    Summary:
    1. Primary Request and Intent:
       - Analyze iOS image compression codebase and create CLAUDE.md documentation
       - Build iOS app "Ziply" with SwiftUI following provided mockups
       - Implement photo compression app with 5 screens: Onboarding, Photo Selection, Preview Results, Compression Progress, and Results
       - Fix build errors and state management issues
       - Add custom date range picker to supplement the 3 preset date options

    2. Key Technical Concepts:
       - SwiftUI with iOS 15.0+ deployment target
       - MVVM architecture pattern
       - Photos Framework (PHPhotoLibrary, PHAsset, PHAssetCollection)
       - @EnvironmentObject for state management
       - NavigationView (iOS 15 compatible, not NavigationStack)
       - Photo library permissions handling
       - Image compression with metadata preservation

    3. Files and Code Sections:
       - CLAUDE.md
          - Project documentation and guidance for future Claude instances
          - Updated to reflect "Ziply" name and current project structure

       - ZiplyApp.swift
          - Main app entry point, removed Core Data dependencies
          - Added @StateObject for AppState and environment injection
          ```swift
          @main
          struct ZiplyApp: App {
              @StateObject private var appState = AppState.shared

              var body: some Scene {
                  WindowGroup {
                      OnboardingView()
                          .environmentObject(appState)
                  }
              }
          }
          ```

       - PhotoSelectionView.swift
          - Main photo selection screen with date range and size filters
          - Fixed to use @EnvironmentObject instead of @StateObject
          - Currently has 3 date range buttons (Last Week, Last Month, Last 3 Months)
          ```swift
          struct PhotoSelectionView: View {
              @EnvironmentObject var appState: AppState
              @State private var showPreviewResults = false
              // ...
          }
          ```

       - PhotoLibraryService.swift
          - Core service for photo library operations
          - Added authorization handling and debug logging
          - Implements photo fetching with date/size filters
          ```swift
          class PhotoLibraryService: NSObject, ObservableObject, PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver {
              static let shared = PhotoLibraryService()
              @Published var authorizationStatus: PHAuthorizationStatus = .notDetermined
              // ...
          }
          ```

       - AppState.swift
          - Centralized state management
          - Fixed MainActor issue by adding @MainActor annotation
          ```swift
          @MainActor
          class AppState: ObservableObject {
              static let shared = AppState()
              @Published var photoSelectionViewModel = PhotoSelectionViewModel()
              private init() {}
          }
          ```

    4. Errors and fixes:
       - "cannot find '$viewModel' in scope":
         - Fixed by creating custom binding instead of direct $ binding
         - Changed from `$viewModel.minimumPhotoSize` to `Binding(get:set:)`

       - "call to main actor-isolated initializer 'init()' in a synchronous nonisolated context":
         - Fixed by adding @MainActor annotation to AppState class

       - NavigationStack iOS 16+ compatibility:
         - Fixed by replacing NavigationStack with NavigationView for iOS 15 support

       - State not updating in UI:
         - Fixed by switching from @StateObject to @EnvironmentObject pattern
         - Added proper environment object injection through view hierarchy

    5. Problem Solving:
       - Successfully transitioned from Core Data template to clean SwiftUI app
       - Implemented complete navigation flow between all 5 screens
       - Resolved state management issues for reactive UI updates
       - Added photo library authorization handling with proper checks

    6. All user messages:
       - "I have added Mockups in @Mockups/ Directory, Screens are named from screen 1 to screen 5. For now, do not worry about the settings screen; keep it just
    blank where we are showing a test message or the version number."
       - "Ok, now let me setup the new blank app from xcode. Then we can continue"
       - "I created app with name ziply. You can look at the structure and modify the structure if needed or update your claude.md file if the projet is having good
    structure."
       - "Ok, The app is running now. Go Ahead, Build next set of things now"
       - "Have you done something wrong, why do we have 2 ZiplyApp.swift"
       - "I have already installed tools like xcode-select, xcode-build-server and codelldb etc, can you run build command from command line"
       - "Yes go ahead" (in response to cleaning up template code)
       - "I am getting these build errors - [build errors shown]"
       - "It seems like the state is broken now, When i am chaning date or slider the values in the ui is not updated and it is also not finding any images"
       - "The UI is rendered like this right now. You notice the date selection option only has three selectables. They also want to enable users to select the date
    using a date picker. Can you make the add additional UI for us to select the date range which is totally custom."

    7. Pending Tasks:
       - Add custom date range picker UI to PhotoSelectionView
       - Implement actual image compression logic
       - Implement saving compressed images back to Photos library
       - Add background task support for large batches

    8. Current Work:
       User showed a screenshot of the current UI and requested adding a custom date range picker. The current implementation only has 3 preset buttons (Last Week,
    Last Month, Last 3 Months). User wants to add date pickers for fully custom date range selection.

    9. Optional Next Step:
       Add a custom date range option with date pickers to PhotoSelectionView, allowing users to select any date range beyond the 3 preset options. This will involve:
       - Adding a "Custom Range" button alongside existing date range buttons
       - Implementing date picker UI for start and end dates
       - Updating the view model to handle custom date ranges.
