## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Core Image Processing Pipeline

```swift
// Simplified processing flow
1. Load PHAsset from Photos library
2. Identify all albums containing the photo
3. Request high-quality image data with metadata
4. Create CIImage from image data
5. Calculate optimal resize dimensions (max 1500px)
6. Apply resize transformation using Core Image
7. Compress to JPEG with specified quality (75%)
8. Preserve original metadata using ImageIO
9. Save processed image back to Photos library
10. Add compressed photo to corresponding albums
```

### 2. Album Preservation Strategy

```swift
// Album relationship tracking and recreation
1. Query PHAssetCollection for each PHAsset to identify album membership
2. Create compressed versions of albums ("Compressed - [Album Name]")
3. Maintain album hierarchy (folders, smart albums, shared albums)
4. Add processed photos to corresponding compressed albums
5. Preserve album metadata (title, creation date, custom sort order)
```

### 3. Background Processing Strategy

```swift
// Background task management
1. Register background processing task identifier
2. Start background task when processing begins
3. Continue processing during app backgrounding
4. Send local notifications for completion
5. Handle task expiration gracefully
```

### 4. Memory Management Approach

```swift
// Efficient memory usage
1. Process photos individually to minimize memory footprint
2. Use autorelease pools for batch operations
3. Implement image data streaming for large files
4. Clean up temporary resources after each photo
5. Monitor memory warnings and adjust processing accordingly
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Album Preservation in Native iOS

### How Album Preservation Works

Unlike EXIF metadata (which is embedded in image files), **album information in iOS is managed by the Photos framework** and stored in the system's Photos database. This means:

#### ‚úÖ **What We CAN Do with Native iOS:**
- **Query Album Membership**: Use `PHAssetCollection` to find which albums contain each photo
- **Create Compressed Albums**: Automatically create "Compressed - [Album Name]" versions
- **Maintain Hierarchy**: Preserve folder structure and album relationships  
- **Support All Album Types**: User albums, Smart albums, Shared albums
- **Preserve Album Metadata**: Album titles, creation dates, sort orders

#### üîß **Technical Implementation:**
```swift
// Example: Finding albums for a photo
func getAlbumsForAsset(_ asset: PHAsset) -> [PHAssetCollection] {
    let collections = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(
        containing: asset, 
        with: .album, 
        options: nil
    )
    return collections.objects(at: IndexSet(0..<collections.count))
}

// Example: Creating compressed album
func createCompressedAlbum(from originalAlbum: PHAssetCollection) {
    let title = "Compressed - \(originalAlbum.localizedTitle ?? "Photos")"
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetCollection(withTitle: title)
    })
}
```

#### üì± **User Experience:**
- **Automatic Organization**: Compressed photos appear in corresponding albums
- **Clear Naming**: "Compressed - Vacation 2024" makes relationships obvious
- **Flexible Options**: Keep originals, replace, or create separate compressed albums
- **Album Preview**: Show which albums will be affected before processing

#### üÜö **Advantage Over CLI Approach:**
The native iOS app can preserve album organization seamlessly, while a CLI app would lose this information since it only accesses exported image files without the Photos database context.

## üéØ Future Considerations

- **Machine Learning**: Intelligent quality adjustment based on photo content
- **Cloud Integration**: iCloud Photos optimization
- **Apple Watch**: Companion app for processing status
